# Hard Surface Helper - A Blender Addon Scripted in Python

This addon is desing to help with several repetitives tasks encountered while
hard surface modeling in Blender.

There are options to automatically move the bevel on an object to the bottom of
the modifier stack to make sure that the bevel applies to all boolean cuts on 
the object.

The addon also allows for rapidly disabling clamp overlap and enabling hardened
normals.

## Installation

To use the addon, download and install it using the Blender addon interface

## Planned Updates

- Add the option to modify the cuts and size of the bevel in the UI menu.

- Add the ability to move Boolean cutters to the hide collection.

- Modify the clamp overlap and hardened normals tools to verify that a bevel
  is present to prevent an error, and modify both to make them togglable on/off
